## 1. Introduction and Theoretical Framework

* **Local Scope:** It has meaning exclusively within the local router where it is configured and is not propagated via BGP routing updates to neighbors.

## 2. Topology and BGP Neighbor Establishment

The topology consists of four routers across different Autonomous Systems (AS 100, AS 200, AS 300, and AS 400). Before advertising prefixes, BGP neighbor adjacencies were established on each device.
